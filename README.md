# CTLCDeidentifier
The Deidentifier program allows users to deidentify and
submit CT studies and metadata to the 
Early Lung Imaging Confederation dataset. It includes a DICOM anonymizer to remove PHI before
submission. The anonymizer is pre-configured to meet the requirements for submission, but users
who have special de-identification requirements may control the actions of the anonymizer on
each DICOM element type. The program also provides simple viewers for both images and DICOM 
elements to allow the user to confirm the actions of the anonymizer before submission to the
dataset.
